# BassBlock

Simple Spotify clone. 
I used Exoplayer API for playing mp3 files (songs) 
which I saved within a remote database provided by Google Firebase (Store fore files & 
Firestore for my own data serialization).

// - HOW TO CLONE AND USE IT
1. clone the github repository using the link
2. create (if you don't have a firebase account)
3. create a new project in your firebase console
4. put the .json file from it inside the project (inside the /app folder)
5. you are ready to go
