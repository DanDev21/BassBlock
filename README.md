# BassBlock

Simple Spotify clone. 
I used Exoplayer API for playing mp3 files (songs) 
which I saved within a remote database provided by Google Firebase (Store fore files & 
Firestore for my own data serialization).

// - HOW TO CLONE AND USE IT
1. clone the github repository using the link
2. create (if you don't have a firebase account)
3. create a new project in your firebase console
4. be careful when you create the objects inside the firestore (to match the objects inside the memory and name their fields exactly the same like those from app/src/main/java/com/dan/bassblock/feature_play_music/domain/data/model/Song.kt 
6. put the .json file from it inside the project (inside the /app folder)
7. you are ready to go
